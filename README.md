<h2>Hi there, I'm Eric ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm a graphic designer and a photographer lover, but it wasn't until I discovered the fascinating world of web development that I knew what it was like to do what you are really passionate about.

This is my github's profile where I share my projects and you can take a look at my code and what I've been creating.

These are some of the tecnologies I use:
